## Problem-Statement

The  goal in this analysis (the Analysis or the Project) is thus to predict if a loan remains current or if it will
default given that it has already been originated by a third party bank and purchased by Lending Club indirectly
through its investors. Mathematically, we present the problem statement as:

**Pr(Loan remains current | Loan has been funded)**

The probability that a loan remains current, or alternatively 1 less the probability that the loan defaults is relevant
to both the Company as well as the investors/holders of the notes that funded the purchase the loan. LC can
benefit from better understanding what loans will default once funded and further **improve their underwriting
models for future loans, and for investors, the ability to predict if a loan will default or remain current is essential
to understanding their expected return on investment of the loan.** For purposes of the Project, I  defined a loan to
be in default if it is in technical violation of the loan agreement, thus if it has defaulted or if the borrower has
missed a loan payment; we discuss the basis for this grouping further in this report.

## Data-Overview

The datasets from Lending Club are publicly available2. These datasets contain comprehensive information on
all loans purchased by the company between 2007 and Q4 of 2019 (a new updated data set is made available
every quarter). For purposes of the Analysis, I used eight quarters data ranging from 1Q2018 – 4Q2019, as this
represented the most recent loan data. Thus master data set was aggregated across eight separate data files and
compiled into a single dataset. The primary key for the data set is ID. The master data set file contains
1,012,366 tuples with **150 predictor**s including the response variable. We identified the response variable as
LOAN_STATUS with a cardinality of {Current, Charged Off, Default, Fully Paid, In Grace Period, Late (16-30
Days), Late (31-120 Days}. The dataset is highly dimensional with 149 predictors comprised of a mix of
numeric, categorical and date data types that describe each loan purchased by the Company. Predictor features
of a loan include: loan issue date, interest rate, loan amount, loan terms, next payment date, annual income of
borrower, among others.

### Data Collection and Cleaning

**Response Variable**
For the data set as discussed above, the response variable has been defined as a loan being current or having
defaulted.**LOAN_STATUS** is the variable indicating loan status. The loan Status variable defines those who are
**fully Paid (16.83% ), Current status of the loan (75.8%) and Defaulted (less than 1% of the data) , charged
off(4.5%) of the data**. We could the conclude from the data that major portion consists of the Current status of
the loan

**Numerical Predictors:**

One of the important input feature we have explored are LOAN_AMNT which is the loan amount. From the
below plot and Table , we can infer that the loan amount varies between as minimum of 1000$ up to maximum
of 40000. The mean of the loan amount is $16253 and as the box plot suggests, the majority of the loans are
somewhere between $10000 - $20000. It is important to look at how loan amount is distributed among the data.
The distributions of the numerical variables are to be considered for exploration while building the model􀀀􀀀

- **Fico Score Vs Loan Status:**

From the box plot we observe that median FICO scores are much higher for current loans compared to defaulted
ones. These FICO scores provide the information on how likely loan status could go Default.
- **Installment Vs Loan Status:**
Installment amount varies largely between 261.4 to 693 with median of 450.Based on the plot, we can say that
loans defaulted have on average higher installment amount

- **Term Length**
There are two categories in Term Length. One with 36 month term the loan was borrowed and other is 60
months. We could see there are higher proportions of those with 36 month term with 693412 and 60 months with

### Data-Preprocessing-&-Preparation



- **Univariate Analysis**
performed univariate analysis on each of the features to check for its variance against the target variable
LOAN_STATUS. Zero-Variance features and the ones having higher percentage of unique values were removed.
- **Multicollinearity**
To understand the relationship between multiple variables and attributes in the dataset i ran correlation matrix
on all the numerical features with threshold as 80% and selected the co-related variable exhibiting maximum
variance to the response.
- **Outlier Analysis**
We performed outlier analysis on all the features that had skewed data distribution.
For identifying outliers Winsorization outlier technique was used. Winsorization replaces extreme values with
the quantiles, rather than removing. This gives an advantage over other techniques which result in loss of
information. Below is the density plot for ANNUAL INCOME feature, from the plot we can see that ANNUAL
INCOME is normally distributed after outlier treatment.

### Market-Basket-Analysis

### Principal-Component-Analysis
The  data set was reduced by 50% in observations and in dimensionality by all variables removed in MBA analysis. Furthermore, all near zero variance predictors were removed and only completeobservations selected; PCA runs only on numerical features and thus only numerical predictors were included.
PCA returned 58 orthogonal axes using 17 predictor variables to describe the total variance in the predictor set.
The first 16 principal components are considered relevant with eigenvalues greater than 1.0, and cumulatively
serve to explain approximately 78.9% of the variance in the predictor data set. Examination of the first ф[1,5]
loading vectors indicates that the first 5 eigenvectors (principal components) describe the following features of a
loan:

• PC1: total # credit lines of borrower
• PC2: loan amount and installment of borrower
• PC3: length of time of open credit accounts
• PC4: borrower FICO scores
• PC5: total $ balance on all credit lines of borrower
